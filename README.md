ML model to predict Solana token graduation using XGBoost

# Solana Token Graduation Prediction

Machine Learning project to predict whether a Solana-based token will successfully graduate, using supervised learning techniques.

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end ML pipeline to classify Solana tokens based on their likelihood of graduation. The model is trained using structured data and focuses on feature engineering and model optimization.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering using mathematical transformations
- Supervised classification using XGBoost
- Model evaluation and performance analysis

## Tech Stack
- Python
- XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The model demonstrates strong predictive performance using engineered features and gradient boosting techniques.

## Notes
This project was developed as part of a Kaggle challenge and focuses on applied machine learning rather than blockchain implementation.
